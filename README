Code for an interesting NLP problem. 

sample_input.csv contains 3 columns: Vendor, Product and Version. 
These entries have been created by humans, so are not very consistent.

dict.csv contains a standard dictionary. This has been created by parsing 
the XML standard provided by NIST at 
http://static.nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cpe/dictionary/official-cpe-dictionary_v2.2.xml

We would like to match each entry in input.csv to an accurate entry in 
dict.csv. If there is no matching entry in the dictionary, we would like 
to output NA.

match_cpe.py is my attempt at solving this problem using NLP techniques.

Usage:

./match_cpe.py <input csv file> <dictionary csv file>
